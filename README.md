This is a port from zx spectrum to zx81, of a racing game from an old typein tutorial? credit to "Jon Kingsman". This was added as a comment on youtube video. 

requires tasm to be installed and the zxasm wrapper (see here for info https://perfectlynormalsite.com/zx81qstart.html )

The main code is in racing.asm

Currently only tested on 16K zx81 emulator called EightyOne.
